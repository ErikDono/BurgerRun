## Node JS and My Thought Process 

I am really enjoying SQL, and this project was even more fun than the last! This application will impliment a baisc CRUD (witout the delete at the moment) operation, and allow a user to edit and keep a list of all burgers eaten! The CRUD works, but at one point my clicks stopped being grabbed from off of the index page. I am working to remedy that.
